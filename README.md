### what's left to do?
- fix small hole placement error in case
- fix battery opening in case
- fix cap placement on pcb right

### Want one?

All production files you need to build your own board can be found [here](./prod). they are certainly usable, but the case might need some scraping/cutting to properly fit the battery. I will fix that soon

The case is split in two parts connected by cylindrical 3x1.7mm magnets. The bottom case is open by design and ends at a bit under the hotswap sockets. It's meant to be used with self adhesive neopren sheets (2-3mm thick), which are cut to be the same size as the pcb and then glued on top of the underside of the pcb.
