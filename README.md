### Lütt un Lütt

- MX hotswap sockets (choc v1 hotswap sockets)
- rotary encoder
- case files are supplied (stl, dxf, as well as the freecad files)
- supports both nice!nano and pro micro
- QMK, ZMK, etc. support with pro micro, or ZMK with nice!nano
- completely open source, permissive license ([CERN-OHL-P](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home))

## what's left to do?

- fix small hole placement error in case
- fix cap placement on pcb right
- enable support of Elite-C/Pi
- fix everything else, early stages of change so there is much to do
