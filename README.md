3x5+2 key split orthogonal BLE keyboard

This fork is a custom version of weteor's L端tt un L端tt, altered such that it is powered by a pair of LiPO batteries rather than coin cells, and uses MX switches. The full list of features and their changes are shown below.

## Features

- Diode-less pcb, since there are enough GPIO pins on the nice!nano
- full BLE, powered by 3.7v 110mAh LiPO batteries (coin cells (CR2032))
- MX hotswap sockets (choc v1 hotswap sockets)
- rotary encoder
- case files are supplied (stl, dxf, as well as the freecad files)
- supports both nice!nano and pro micro
- QMK, ZMK, etc. support with pro micro, or ZMK with nice!nano
- completely open source, permissive license ([CERN-OHL-P](https://cern-ohl.web.cern.ch/home))

## what's left to do?

- fix small hole placement error in case
- fix cap placement on pcb right
- enable support of Elite-C/Pi
- fix everything else, early stages of change so there is much to do
